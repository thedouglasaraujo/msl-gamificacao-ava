## Objective
This repository aims to provide transparency and reproducibility of the systematic
literature mapping process, including:
- Search strings
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria
- Study selection flow (PRISMA)
- Data extraction and synthesis

## Tools
- StArt (State of the Art through Systematic Review)
- IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus
- Snowballing via Connected Papers


## How to Replicate
1. Execute the search strings in the selected databases
2. Apply deduplication
3. Perform title and abstract screening
4. Perform full-text screening
5. Extract and synthesize data following the PRISMA guidelines
